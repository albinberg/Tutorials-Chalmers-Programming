# Programming Tutorials for Chalmers
In this repo I plan on posting mostly notes, examples and tutorials for those studying Programming at IEM at Chalmers.

## Get started
The tutorials are supposed to be independent from eachother but the recommended order to read them:
2. Unix
3. Git
(4. Markdown)


I also plan on making an interactive jupyter notebook (reading material mixed with interactive code blocks in one single document.)
