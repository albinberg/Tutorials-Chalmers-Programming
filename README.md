# Programming Tutorials for Chalmers

## Get started
The tutorials are supposed to be independent from eachother but the recommended order to read them:

1. Unix and the Terminal
2. Git and Github
3. Markdown for notes
4. Using the `json` library

- [ ] I also plan on making an interactive jupyter notebook (reading material mixed with interactive code blocks in one single document) for learning Python interacrively.
