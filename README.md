# Programming Tutorials for Chalmers
In this repo I plan on posting mostly notes, examples and tutorials for those studying Programming at IEM at Chalmers.

## Get started
The tutorials are supposed to be independent from eachother but the recommended order to read them:

1. Unix and the Terminal
2. Git and Github
3. Markdown for notes
4. Using the `json` library

- [ ] I also plan on making an interactive jupyter notebook (reading material mixed with interactive code blocks in one single document) for learning Python interacrively.

If anything in the tutorials is confusing or wrong. Please contact me on albinvberg@gmail.com. ChatGPT, copilot or similar is also great if you need help for a specific case! ;)
